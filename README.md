# nonogram game

Let's make a [nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) game in C++!  But wait, there are rules...

Rules:

1. You must play it by entering / editing C++ source code
2. It must be visually satisfying (the source should resemble the puzzle and the picture should be apparent)
3. **No string literals** or macros generating string literals in the puzzle or entry

Bonus:

1. ...and it prints the picture when run (string usage relaxed here)
2. ...and it's constexpr! (so it fails to compile until the puzzle is valid!)
